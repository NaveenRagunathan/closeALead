# {PROGRAM_NAME}

## Opening Hook
I'm pumped to hear you're interested in the *{PROGRAM_NAME}* ({TRANSFORMATION_METRIC})

I am going to go straight into it and won't bore you with some backstory because I value your time.

So I'd like to work with you over the next {DURATION} to turn you into {TARGET_TRANSFORMATION}.

## The Outcome (Concrete & Measurable)
The outcome is simple:

Build the {SYSTEMS_SKILLS_INFRASTRUCTURE} you need to {MAIN_BENEFIT} while {LIFESTYLE_BENEFIT}.

You will be able to {PRIMARY_PROMISE} without {PAIN_POINT} which is {EMOTION_TRIGGER} you would rather be spending on {BETTER_USE}.

You'll end the program with a {BUSINESS_MODEL_TYPE} that leverages {KEY_DIFFERENTIATOR} to make things a lot more easier.

*The Math:* I'm aiming to add *${REVENUE_RANGE_LOW} - ${REVENUE_RANGE_HIGH}* to your {BUSINESS_TYPE} (depending on what you already have in place)

And I'll give you everything you need to make that happen without {BIGGEST_FEAR}.

## The Problem Stack (3 Problems)
To do that, we'll solve the three biggest problems that keeps {TARGET_AUDIENCE} stuck at a particular income level:

*Problem 1:* {PROBLEM_A} to {TARGET_OUTCOME_A}

*Problem 2:* {PROBLEM_B} with {CONSEQUENCE_B}

*Problem 3:* {PROBLEM_C} leading to {CONSEQUENCE_C}
